B-B-B-B-Beat
---

v0.9.4

A repeater inspired by [Ableton's Beat Repeat](https://www.ableton.com/en/blog/guide-beat-repeat-quantize-courses/) for [Norns](https://monome.org/norns), with some added glitchy inspiration from [MASF Possessed](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=masf+possessed)/[MWFX Judder](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=mwfx+judder).

This script uses live audio or samples for all of its repeating magic! Read more about the different modes in the [guide](./GUIDE.md#modes).
