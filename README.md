B-B-B-B-Beat
---

A blatant copy of [Ableton's Beat Repeat](https://www.ableton.com/en/blog/guide-beat-repeat-quantize-courses/) for Norns, with some added glitchy inspiration from [MASF Possessed](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=masf+possessed)/[MWFX Judder](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=mwfx+judder).

## Requirements

[Norns](https://monome.org/norns) or [Fates](https://llllllll.co/t/fates-a-diy-norns-dac-board-for-raspberry-pi/22999) or device. For Fates owners, BPM value can be persistently controlled using the 4th encoder, for Norns owners it's `E2` the first page `P0`


## Install/Update

Since B-B-B-B-Beat is still a bit rough around the edges the only way to install is described below under [Development](#development).

**After install or update `RESET` or `SLEEP` is required, because B-B-B-B-Beat installs a new engine.**


## Params

Here's a table of all the controls and their values (also listed within the params menu).
